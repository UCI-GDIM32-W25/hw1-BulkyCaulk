Put your notes from the W1L2 (Thurs, Jan 9) in-class activity here.

## Devlog
Prompt: Include the HW1 break-down exercise you wrote during the Week 1 - Lecture 2 (Jan 9) in-class activity (above). If you did not attend and perform this activity, review the lecture slides and write your own plan for how you believe HW1 should be built. If your initially proposed plan turned out significantly different than the activity answers given by Prof Reid, you may want to note what was different. Then, write about how the plan you wrote in the break-down connects to the code you wrote. Cite specific class names and method names in the code and GameObjects in your Unity Scene.


Write your Devlog here!
What I wrote down originally was very bare bones compared to Professor Reid's plan. I only had the objects that I saw. I added a few things to mine in class but it still needed more work. I first updated my plan to have more detail before I started coding so that I could follow it as a guide. After finishing with my code, I noticed that my UI plan takes more of the logic for the counters _numSeedPlanted and _numSeedLeft. The player object in code is somewhat similar to the plan, I was missing references to the UI and Plant game objects(the PlantCountUI and plant prefab). It has a speed component(_speed), ability(this would be the method PlantSeed), and an amount of seeds(_numSeeds) allowed just like in the code.
